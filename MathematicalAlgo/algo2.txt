write an algo to show the results below:

N    ==>            output

0    ==>    
1    ==>  -1 0 3
2    ==>  -4 -3 0
3    ==>  -9 -8 -5 10
4    ==>  -16 -15 -12 3
5    ==>  -25 -24 -21 -6 99
6    ==>  -36 -35 -32 -17 88

hint: if n is even you have to stop the loop at (n/2)(include) otherwise at (n+1)/2(include)
